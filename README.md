# weather-forecast-rnn
A deep dive into long-term weather forecasting using the Max Planck Institute weather station dataset. This notebook builds and compares various deep learning models (Dense, CNN, LSTM, GRU) in Keras to predict future temperature, evaluating their performance against a common-sense baseline.
